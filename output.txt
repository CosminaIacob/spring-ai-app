CDWA has replaced the Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) as the new administrative employer for Individual Providers (IPs) in Washington. Under this new employment model, CDWA is providing employment support for IPs, while consumers will continue as managing employers. This transition allows DSHS to focus primarily on consumer case management. Consumers should continue working with their case managers to create a Plan of Care and access needed services. Once a consumer has chosen an IP to work with, they should ensure the IP completes CDWA's hiring requirements before starting work. It's important not to schedule an IP to work or start work until CDWA has provided authorization. Consumers can refer to the Managing Employer Handbook for more details on CDWAâ€™s consumer resources. All IPs must complete CDWA's hiring requirements, and consumers need an "Okay to Work" authorization from CDWA before care can begin. IPs can find more information in the IP Employment Handbook on CDWA's IP Resources. Remember, it's crucial to confirm with CDWA that the care provider has received authorization before they start working.
